### In this repo, I am showing the process review of week 10 in makers academy.

I was asked to write a program that:

Asks a question from the user.

receives the answer

checks if the answer is correct or not.

I did it under time pressure.

I got the following feedback from "Sophie", the coach in makers academy:

"You stick to TDD in a good way. You passed your first test in minute 10, it shows you are
fluent in coding with ruby. The only thing that I did not like was that when you got stuck in
testing the input taking, you wrote the test not in a proper way."
